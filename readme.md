# Monga [![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/FrenkyNet/Monga.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/FrenkyNet/Monga)

A simple and swift MongoDB abstraction layer for PHP5.3+

## What's this all about? 

* An easy API to get connections, databases and collection.
* A filter builder that doesn't make your mind go nuts.
* All sorts of handy update functions.
* An abstraction for sorting single results.
* GridSF support for a Mongo filesystem.

## Vision

Monga was created with the acknowledgement of the MongoDB PHP package already being pretty awesome. That's why in a lot of cases Monga is just a simple wrapper around the MongoDB classes. It provides some helpers and helps you set up queries using a query builder. Which you cal also choose not to use! All will still works accordingly. During the development a lot of planning has gone into creating a nice streamlined API that closely follows the MongoDB base classes, while complementing existing query builder for SQL-like database.

## Todo's

* Indexing
* Geospatial helpers
* Docs
