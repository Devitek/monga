Monga was created with the acknowledgment of the MongoDB PHP package already being pretty awesome. That's why in a lot of cases Monga is just a simple wrapper around the MongoDB classes. It provides some helpers and helps you set up queries using a query builder. Which you can also choose not to use! Everything will still work accordingly. During the development, a lot of planning has gone into creating a nice streamlined API that closely follows the MongoDB base classes, while complementing existing query builders for SQL-like databases.

Highlights
----------

* An easy API to get connections, databases and collections.
* A filter builder that doesn't make your mind go nuts.
* All sorts of handy update functions.
* An abstraction for sorting single results.
* GridFS support for a Mongo filesystem.
* Easy aggregation and distinct values.
